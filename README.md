# AndroidLearningResources

Personal Android Development Resources of all types of topics with my simple explanation about each of it.

## Goal of this

I started collecting resources and writing notes for myself to improve my learning experience and memorize new knowledge better and thought other developers may be interested in looking at my notes one day to find specific topic to learn and get enough links to research it without Google'ing by themselves.

## Structure

As of now I have two places where I put different type of content.
- Android Learning Resources.txt
- Android Code Snippets.txt

Android Learning resources is split into two parts:
1. Personal notes about specific topic I learned 
2. Second part contains resources for learning Android, Software Engineering, UI/UX and other. Text file has a topic name and below it links which I gathered from Medium and Google. Whenever I finish reading an article, I change '-' to '+' so I know I read it.

Android Code Snippets contains short, simple yet unique snippets to help memorizing specific class patterns, and have a "repository" of classes that may come in handy in every type of project.
