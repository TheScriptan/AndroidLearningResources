/*
 * <-----------------------------NOTES ABOUT THINGS I LEARN----------------------------->
 */


1. ScrollView - Scrollable Text with LinearLayout can have multiple scrolling texts
2. Explicit Intent - prompt activity in my app and have specific name of it. Example: LoginActivity -> MainActivity
3. Implicit Intent - look for intents beyond the scope of my app. Example: Web browser, Camera
4. ShareCompat.IntentBuilder 					Share button
           .from(this)
           .setType(mimeType)
           .setChooserTitle("Share this text with: ")
           .setText(txt)
           .startChooser();
5. public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) - save state when rotating a device, only for small data. Large data is handled by ViewModel & LiveData
6. Toast Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), message, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show(); Simple popup messages
7. RadioButtons and Spinners - Good way to get user input
8. Toolbar class for App Bar - By disabling in-built toolbar, I can add my own toolbar and have more customization power on it
9. PopupMenu - Set onLongClickListener and initialize popupmenu to have great user interaction
10. TabLayout + Toolbar + ViewPager + Fragments gives nice way to scroll through fake pages that are fragments
11. RecyclerView is the go to for holding lists in a view.
12. To create button pressed https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3882064/how-to-change-color-of-button-in-android-when-clicked
onClick(View view) {view.setBackground(getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.selectorXML))}
13. ProgressBar. Very easy to set up. progressBar.getProgress(); progressBar.setProgress();
14. Navigation Drawer from the left opens up to the right
15. Bottom navigation bar
16. Snackbar is similar to Toast except it opens up with a small black border from the bottom.
17. ArrayAdapter is useful to put ArrayList into it so ListView can retrieve data from ArrayAdapter that prepares TextViews to send to ListView
	Also I can extend ArrayAdapter class to make list more complicated and have multiple values stored, for instance User that has Name and Surname can be an object, create ArrayList<Users> store it in ArrayAdapter and then set ListView adapter's to usersAdapter. Also override getView to create multiple views in one list. (But RecyclerView > ListView so not using ListView anymore)
18. ImageIcon setVisibility(View.GONE) automatically deletes the imageview and corrects alignment in the XML file.
19. MediaPlayer.create(this, R.raw.music); player.start(); player.stop(); player.getDuration(); player.getCurrentPosition(); ALl of this can be used to create a MediaPlayer and combine it with a seekbar
20. SeekBar. A MP3-like progress bar that can be skipped et, cetera. seekbar.setProgress(int) ant that is it, just need to have a updated variable
21. Handler h = new Handler(); h.postDelayed(loopedFunction, miliseconds); loopedFunction Runnable will be updated every time x miliseconds passes, good for async tasks
22. Async callbacks retrieves action to the synchronous when something occurs, for example MediaPlayer.setOnCompletionListener activates when song ends
23. <FrameLayout
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:background="@color/category_numbers">
        <TextView
            android:id="@+id/numbers"
            style="@style/CategoryStyle"
            android:background="?android:attr/selectableItemBackground"
            android:text="@string/category_numbers" />
    </FrameLayout>
    Allows to have a view with its own background and whenever it is clicked, it will show circle ripple effect that it was clicked. Crazy simple
24. ViewPager + PagerAdapter + TabLayout gives fragmented views where you can swipe left and right to switch fragments. 
25. ContentProvider - Manages access to a structured set of data.
	- Good abstraction layer between data source & UI code (can add data validation, can modify how data is stored and UI code is not unaffected)
	- Share data with other apps
	- Works well with other Android Framework classes
	- Centralizes accesing and editing of the data via content provider. Activity -> ContentProvider -> BaseDbHelper of SQLiteDB (query, insert, update, delete methods)
	- WORKS the same as my SEP3 project. BaseActivity -> Content Resolver -> Content Provider -> SQLiteDB. 3 Tier architecture. ACtivity acts as front end, sends request to content resolver aka business logic which then consumes local web services from Content Provider which acts like Persistence exposing web services and ContentProvider manages all the connection to the database.
ContentURI - A content URI is a URI that identifies data in a provider
	- Can point to a part of a database (single row or combination of tables)
	- Can point to a file (text, photo, other media file)
URIMatcher Matches URI to an integer code, to ensure ContentProvider doesnt try to handle unexpected requests and also determines which database table we need to talk to.
	- content://com.example.android.pets/pets
	- content://com.example.android.pets/pets/# ; # - is a wildcard character, where any integer can be replaced to this wildcard
	- content://com.example.android.pets/pets/* ; * - is a wildcard character, where any string can be replaced to this wildcard
26. Room persistence library
	- Basic Sample App for Room implementation https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/tree/master/BasicSample
	- @Query("SELECT * FROM user WHERE first_name LIKE :first AND "
           + "last_name LIKE :last LIMIT 1")
		User findByName(String first, String last);
		Find one entity by name in Room
	- Consider using DatabaseHelper which stores DAO references, it can give more structure to the project
	- @Embedded tag helps to include POJO within a pojo, for example I have user which has Address class inside of him, annotate Address with @Embedded
	AND also @Embedded(prefix = "word1_") will help to avoid duplicate column names and fix the error
27. Udacity HTTP Networking Notes
	- To display time in an integer variable, use Unix Timestamp, easy to send it through JSON
	- By defining XML shape, a flexible asset is created that will scale across all devices
	- public void completePurchase() throws InvalidPurchaseException this notifies the compiler that programmer MUST handle the exception of this method by using try/catch block
	- Always handle networking requests in a different thread/AsyncTask to never block the on-going thread's and main thread procedures
	- public class MyAsyncTask extends AsyncTask<Params, Progress, Result>
		1. Result doInBackground() {publish Progress(73); return Result;} method that is executed in the background, this is where you request HTTP
		2. onProgressUpdate(Progress p) this method can be used to update UI with the new values to inform the user about the current progress of AsyncTask
		3. void onPostExecute(Result result) to communicate between main thread and background thread need to override this method, because it runs in main thread. This method will be called when doInBackground() finishes.
	- When waiting for HTTP Request implement a ProgressBar to display how long it will take to download API data
	- Check network connectivity and if it does not exist, show it for the user
28. Udacity Firebase SATURDAY SUNDAY MONDAY Notes
	- Firebase Realtime database - sync app data in realtime. Stored in JSON. Arrays are not recommended, only JSON dictionaries
	- FirebaseDatabase class is an entry point to the database
	- DatabaseReference references specific part of the database
	- defined String in DatabaseReference if doesnt exists, creates a new JSOn place to look at for the user
	- When using .push to the database a unique ID (push id is generated)
	- ChildEventListener tracks if there have been any changes in database and is attached to databasereference
	- FirebaseUI opensource library. It handles the UI flow for authenticating with Firebase, implements best practices (Fb, twitter, google, email, github)
	- Clearing out adapter when you log out is important
	- FirebaseAuth & FireBaseAuthAuthStateListener helps to build sign in sign out. Attach, detach them in onResume, onPause
	- FirebaseUser has displayName of his account from Gmail, facebook, twitter et cetera. 
	- AuthUI.createSignInIntentBuilder creates a whole new activity just for logging in
	- AuthUI.getInstance().signout(Context context) signs out the user without worries
	- FirebaseApp.initialize has to happen in Application class. Need to write Name for application in manifest, create a class extending application and in overriden onCreate method initialize FirebaseApp OOOOR downgrade google.play.services to 4.0.0
	- Firebase needs an empty constructor in a model class!
29. MVVM: (Fragment (View) -> ViewModel -> Repository -> Data Sources (Room, Firebase, Retrofit) Two-way communication
	- Repositories, Data Source handler files are made as singletons and I can initialize them in InjectorUtils to send ApplicationContext if needed, and use  ViewModelProviders.Factory to initialize Repository in ViewModel
	- It is good to have InjectorUtils.java file where I can initialize repository, database, networkSource, firebase et cetera
	- When using MVVM + Room + Retrofit + Repository, to sync web services with Room, do this: Retrofit gets web api request done, onResponse create new Runnable there and add web service data to Room
	- MVVM packaging: com.example.application (views, activities, viewmodels); com.example.business (repository, daos, database, networking, et cetera) + Utils (InjectorUtils & AppExecutors)
	- Database should have a DatabaseHelper class which contains all DAO interfaces
30. ViewModel
	- ViewModel vs. onSaveInstanceState. Store all data in ViewModel while store important and short data in onSaveInstance for example ViewModel has all attributes and onSaveInstanceState has userId
	- ViewModelProviders.of when first called in onCreate initialized ViewModel, but when activity destroys itself and calls onCreate again, it calls pre-existing ViewModel
	- The constructor that is automatically called by ViewModelProvider is the default one - it takes no arguments. If you want to create a different constructor for a view model, you'll need to make a view model provider factory. 
	- ViewModelProvider.Factory overrides create method which is invoked when ViewModel is created when used ViewModelProviders.of(this, factory).get(class.class), by using factory you can create custom constructors for ViewModel classes and initialize repository in a more efficient way, for example using InjectorUtils
	- ViewModel can also be used to share data between fragments easily
	- To share data between Fragments and whole app, in fragments don't use this when instantiating ViewModel but use getActivity in ViewModelProvider method
	- It may be a good practice to have all of the business logic like if, switch statements inside of a viewmodel to handle states and much more, while activities & fragments should only contain widgets and views
	- When querying for data from repository, before that I can change a state for example for a recyclerview with multiple view types
31. LiveData
	- LiveData is an observable data holder. This allows view to observe LiveData without creating rigid dependency paths
	- By using LiveData with Room or Firebase, I do not need to requery as Room returns LiveData automatically when data is updated and Firebase has listeners which can help posting MutableLiveData and sending to Repository LiveData<RetrievedData>
	- If I want to edit stored values inside LiveData I should use MutableLiveData setValue(T) - sets value and notifies attached observers, must be ran in main thread, if I want to run in a background thread, run postValue(T): example  
	liveData.postValue("a");
	liveData.setValue("b"); 
	here first setValue would be executed and value would be b, but then postValue executes and overrides value 'b' with 'a'
	- Note: You must call the setValue(T) method to update the LiveData object from the main thread. If the code is executed in a worker thread, you can use   the postValue(T) method instead to update the LiveData object.
	 Note: LiveData and it's subclasses contain both a setValue() and a postValue() method. The difference is that setValue() must be called from the main thread. postValue() is for when the call occurs off of the main thread. You'll see why you use postValue() next.
	 - When attaching observers to LiveData, ensure that LiveData instance isn't changing, because then you need to attach a new observer and that would be bad practice
	 - When using MVVM with LiveData, try to have MutableLiveData as low as I can in the tiers, for example MutableLiveData should live in Retrofit data source or Room data source
	 - If I get an error somewhere where MutableLiveData exists, postValue(null) so in the views I could catch the null and react accordingly
32. Repository pattern in MVVM
	- Repository class SHOULD have only LiveData and synchronize it from different data sources to create single source of truth in Repository class 
	- In Repository when initializing data, I should make a boolean value to check if data was initialized in this app's lifetime
	- The repository should be the single source of truth for all data operations
	- By using AppExecutors I can create smooth concurrency for repository to evaluate when to fetch data from API or when to retrieve it from Room
33. SharedPreferences are good when you want to save minimum amount of data
34. Dependency injection is the idea that you should make required components available for a class, instead of creating them within the class itself. An example of how the Sunshine code does this is that instead of constructing the WeatherNetworkDatasource within the SunshineRepository, the WeatherNetworkDatasource is created via InjectorUtilis and passed into the SunshineRepository constructor. One of the benefits of this is that components are easier to replace when you're testing.
35. InitializeApplication extends Application. Executes any code before activities are onCreated
36. Chronometer useful in-built class to display chronometer
37. Retrofit2
	- Retrofit allows to serialize/deserialize JSON by using its own modified GSON very easily (There are other deserializers too)
	- Retrofit requests have to run on a parallel thread to UI thread
	- Model has to match the JSON namings, use this: http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/ as a reference 
	- All HTTP requests are written in interface e.g. GithubService.class 
	- It can be useful to initialize Retrofit builder inside the interface so the code is less clunky
	- Example of simple interface is in code snippets
	- To invoke request, use call.enqueue and deserialized object is in onResponse(... Response<List<Contributor> response) response.body();
	- always use response.isSuccessful() before doing any action on onResponse method
	- To use LiveData with it, use MutableLiveData, when onResponse is successfull, do mutableLiveData.postValue(response.body());
	- Let's say I make HTTP GET request of Recipes. First I define Recipe model, then I create RecipeResponse object where I can define List<Recipe> recipeList since Recipe model is defined for Gson converter with SerializedNames and matching attributes to JSOn this should work 
	- SerializedName and Expose annotation automatically handles the setting so you do not need to define setters in the APIResponse objects
	- @Query annotation automatically prepends a '?' before the given value. api/search?key=asdfgberer in this case @Query prepended "?key" but this is prepended only when the query begins, if there is a second query annotated in InterfaceApi class, then it prepends '&'. Example: &q=chicken%20breast.
	- By using ScheduledExecutorService I can define a networking delay for Retrofit so if network requests lasts longer than 3 seconds, I can cancel it. First I submit a runnable to networkIO then I schedule it via AppExecutors class
38. FrameLayout's layout_gravity="bottom|end" - neat code for positioning for example FAB
39. RecyclerView
	- When binding ClickListeners in Adapter, bind them in onBindViewHolder, so getAdapterPosition returns a correct position. Probably not being right here.
	- CodingWIthMitch structured his recycler view very nicely. Check his tuts out. Creating ViewHolder separately increased modularization of RecyclerView + creating onRecyclerViewListener interface helps to decouple onClickListeners from recyclerview adapter to activities/fragments
	- RecyclerViewAdapter can extend RecyclerView.Adapter<RecyclerView.ViewHolder> it is a generic ViewHolder and I can create many ViewHolder classes extending this and it can easily be used in one adapter. Multiple viewholders in one adapter!
	- If I have a custom progress bar and collapsing toolbar, add this line in recyclerview inside of a coordinatorlayout 
		app:layout_behavior="@string/appbar_scrolling_view_behavior" .There is an error prompted by android, but it is just lying... 
	- VerticalItemDecorator
		- Create a class RVItemDecorator extending RecyclerView.ItemDecoration. create constructor with spacing int, override getItemOffsets and set outRect.top = spacing; then initialize RVItemDecorator above setLayoutManager and set it to the recyclerview
	- There are OnScrollListeners which helps you determine if you reached the start or the end of the recyclerview. In onScrollStateChanged use this to determine if the user scrolled to the end of the recyclerview - if(!recyclerView.canScrollVertically(1))
40. ConstraintLayout
	- AutoConnect sets up connections for costraining a view\
	- Aspect ratio is useful to retain 16:9 aspect for different device screens
	- Use barriers to align TextViews with EditText
	- View All Attributes has favorite attribute feature that allows to specify attributes you work with the most in Attributes View
	- If ConstraintLayout lags, turn off Live Rendering
41. AppBar
	- To create Appbar use onCreateOptionsMenu. To listen for selection use onOptionsItemSelected
	- To add listeners for SearchView do so in onCreateOptionsMenu
	- SearchView OnActionExpand has two methods onExpand and onCollapse
	- To listen for user submission, use OnQueryTextListener
	- To collapse SearchView in menu.xml showAsAction="ifRoom|collapseActionView"
	- To collapse searchview use: searchView.setIconified(true); searchView.clearFocus(); searchItem.collapseActionView();
	- ActionProviders are pre-made menu items to handle action, for example ShareActionProvider
42. Fragments
	- To add fragment to backstack, write addToBackStack(null);
	- Commit needs to be last in FragmentTransaction and before commit I can add setTransition to create animations for transition
	- Fragment can communicate with activity easily with getActivity(); e.g TextView textView = getActivity().findViewById(R.id.textView);
	- Activities likewise can communicate with fragments ExampleFragment frag = getSupportFragment().findFragmentById(R.id.example_fragment);
	- Any items added to AppBar from Fragment are appended to the existing AppBar e.g from Activity
	- When using ViewModels always reference a viewModel from activity with getActivity().viewModelName instead of creating a new reference inside of frag
		OR use requireActivity when using ViewModelProviders.of(requireActivity()).get(MyViewModel.class);
43. Navigation Architecture Component
	- Only single activity must contain nav_graph.xml and this activity has NavHostFragment that is found in Containers tab in layout editor
	- To disable going back to LoginFragment, set PopTo to LoginFragment and Inclusive to true
	- To navigate from one fragment to another use this: Navigation.findNavController(MainActivity.this, R.id.nav_host_Fragment).navigate(R.id.emptyFragment)
	- To get current destination of nav_graph.xml use Navigation.findNavController(this, R.id.nav_host_Fragment).getCurrentDestination().getId();
	- FTUE (First-time user experience) this should be kept as a nested graph when users launch the app for the first time.
	- To support navigateUp button, add this public boolean onSupportNavigateUp() { return nav.navigateUp(); }
	- For BottomViewNavigation to work, R.menu IDs has to match with R.navigation ids. main, friendList, userProfile
44. Firebase
	- To have more information about the user, save it in a document/child with name of UID that I can retrieve from FirebaseAuth.getCurrentUser().getUid();
	- POJOs should have a method toMap()
	- When adding objects to Firestore, add them in Map<String, Object> type. String is key, object is value
	- Two ways to reference: CollectionReference & DocumentReference
	- If I don't want duplicate data, define my own IDs
	- ref.add or ref.set has success and failure listeners
	- ref.add(note).addOnSuccessListener has a documentReference where I can retrieve UID
	- Should try to attach LiveData listeners in onStart or onResume (NEED TESTING AS onStart may not work)
	- SnapshotListener has FirebaseFirestoreException and before using documentSnapshot, check if e != null
	- I may need to have attachListeners and detachListeners methods in FirebaseHelper for SnapshotListeners. So this can be called in Activities onStart and onRemove. Or use Executors to do this
	- noteref.set(noteHashMap) method overrides the object, but noteRef.set(note, SetOptions.merge()) solves the issue. This will create new document if it is not existing, if it exists, it will override only existing fields I declared. Or use noteRef.update(noteHashMap) or noteRef.update(MapKey, MapValue);
	- noteRef.addSnapshotListener(Executor executor, eventlistener) returns ListenerRegistration which I can use to remove listener to avoid leaking and avoid using activity reference in FirebaseHelper class. 
	- Note note = documentSnapshot.toObject(Note.class) this automatically retrieves Note object from Firestore
	- QueryDocumentSnapshot guarantees it exists so no need to check for null
	- To exclude unecessary data in Firestore, write @Exclude ONLY above getter of the attribute
	- To make a SIMPLE QUERY write. Such queries can be used only on ONE FIELD. In this example: priority 
		notebookRef.whereGreaterThanOrEqualTo("key", 5).orderBy("priority", Query.Direction.DESCENDING).limit(3).get()...
			- whereGreaterThanOrEqualTo - if key >= 5
			- orderBy - ASCENDING or DESCENDING
			- limit - how many items to display
	- COMPOUND QUERY. Can filter multiple fields, for example: priority, money, streaks, et cetera. To create one I can get a link for Indexed queries via Log.v when mixing two fields to filter, or do it manually
	- MERGE QUERIES. Allows to have OR check not only AND
		Task task1 = notebookRef.whereLessThan("priority", 5);
		Task task2 = notebookRef.whereGreaterThan("priority", 2)
		Task<QuerySnapshot> allTasks = Tasks.whereAllSuccess(task1, task2);
		Then I have to make nested loop to iterate through two queries that got results for individual query settings
	- Firebase Pagination. Query.startAt/startAfter et cetera
		- DocumentSnapshot lastResult; Limit query to 3; set lastResult to queryResult. Check if lastResult was not null, then query = startAfter(lastResult). This basically knows where the last query ended because of the limit and fires a new query
	- DocumentChange. Contains objects that were changed. If I delete 4 documents, DocumentChange will contain 4 objects
		- oldIndex is a position before the change
		- newIndex is a position after the change
		- documentChange.getType() can be but in a switch to see if document got ADDED, MODIFIED, REMOVED
	- Batched write and only write. If it fails at least in one document, none of the changes will be applied. Can run offline
		- batch needs a DocumentReference to manipulate
		- batch.set(docRef, new Object)
		- batch.update(docRef, "Key", "Value");
		- batch.delete(docRef);
	- Transactions can read and write. Also atomic. Can run only online
		- new Transactoin.Function<Return type>. Here I specify what I will return. To return it, attach onSuccessListener and it will give me what I want
45. For managing states of views like button, text view, store many booleans inside of a boolean so states stays relevant
46. Notifications
	- NotificationManager - used to create a notification channel and start a notification using .notify
	- NotificationChannel is important for API 26+. Need to create a static final for NotificationChannel
	- NotificationCompat.Builder creates notification structure. This is where I declare pending intens for user to react with like a button or onSwipe/onDelete notification. Can declare icon, contentTitle, contentText. Best is to make a method to getNotificationCompatBuilder and build on top of it, for example an updateNotification
	- Notifications needs to have a final int NOTIFICATION_ID to be played around with
	- To add receivers to notification create BroadcastReceiver, put it inside of PendingIntent with a method PendingIntent.getBroadcast.
	- NotificationCompat.Builder.addAction creates a button for user to click inside of notification
47. BroadcastReceiver
	- Can create inside a notificationHelper class as an inner class or use Android Studio to create a predefined BroadcastReceiver and setup Manifest file for receiver
48. AlarmManager
	- API 21 AlarmManager has a method calle getNextAlarmClock() that returns next alarm set up on the device 
	-  To set up repeated AlarmManager I need AlarmReceiver where I can deliver notification and to deliver notification I use alarmManager.setInexactRepeating method. I need two time intervals repeatInterval and triggerTime. To apply this to Wake Up Together I could manipulate repeatInterval to the future time of when to wake up and add it to triggerTime and based on that always resetup alarmManager when alarm is updated
49. BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID returns package name and so I could add Intent to this for example. BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID + ".ACTION_CUSTOM_BROADCAST"
50. Glide
	- SOmetimes I need to add this to manifest in order to load images. android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
51. CoordinatorLayout
	- it is required when I want to introduce any type of custom toolbar to the app. This allows to have a collapsable toolbar :O
52. Toolbar
	- Include CollapsingToolbarLayout from Google material design. in XML create AppBarLayout and inside create Toolbar. create scrollFlags attribute with scroll|enterAlways. Voila
53. SearchView
	- setOnQueryTextListener has two methods onTextSubmit and onTextChange so I can lets say update a query whenever user writes something to a searchview
54. ProgressBar
	- HorizontalDottedProgressBar source code: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37741872/how-to-make-custom-dotted-progress-bar-in-android
55. MediatorLiveData
	- Good way to edit data before retrieving it back to the observers
	- Used in repository so you can get access from multiple data sources easily and edit the data before sending it to observers
56. Saved State usage:
	- UI bits: selections, scroll state (when app is killed and user comes back, he would be referenced to the same scrolling state he left in recycler view for example)
	- Navigation state keys (if user is authenticated to the app and kills it, when coming back, he could return to the same activity/fragment )
